# Course Policies

## Learning Objectives

* Identify rhetorical principles of computation and code
* Demonstrate a critical understanding of code within artistic and literary frameworks from the 20th and 21st centuries
* Engage in the creative construction of multiple artifacts exploring rhetorical issues related to code and digital technology
* Identify and explore critically and creatively contemporary issues related to code studies and its intersections with graphic design, computer science, literary studies, and philosophy

## Requirements

This course fulfills the 'Digital Technologies' requirement for the English LWR concentration.

## Grading

A breakdown of the major assignments can be found here. 

Your overall grade for the course is calculated based on the accumulation of up to 1000 total points from our major assignments and class participation: 

* Forum discussion posts - 100 points (10%)
* Critical assessment essay - 100 points (10%)
* Creative project 1 - 200 points (20%)
* Midterm presentation - 50 points (5%)
* Creative project 2 - 200 points (20%)
* Artist's statement - 100 points (10%)
* Final presentation - 100 points (10%)
* In-class participation - 150 points (15%)

I will note that Moodle does not itself possess a flawless means of calculating overall grades with this breakdown (especially for the 200-point creative projects), so take note of the points provided for each assignment in the comments I upload for you. The final grade submitted to Mypack will be calculated properly, outside of Moodle. 

If you ever have any questions about what your grade might be, feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to provide clarification.

Grade points translated to letters (with the overall point total effectively divided by ten to fit this scale):

### Grade Distributions:
<pre>
A+: 98-100| A: 93-97 | A-: 90-92
B+: 88-89 | B: 83-87 | B-: 80-82
C+: 78-79 | C: 73-77 | C-: 70-72
D+: 68-69 | D: 63-67 | D-: 60-62
F: 0-59
</pre>

## Attendance

You have three unexcused absences to use as needed. For each absence beyond the third, I will subtract ten points from your overall score. This point penalty can be avoided if proper documentation is provided to excuse the absence (e.g. doctor's note, receipt from towing company, etc.). 
Accruing more than six absences (whether excused or unexcused) is grounds for failing the course. See [NCSU REG 02.20.3 (Attendance Regulations)](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-3) for more.

## Participation
Student participation will be evaluated based on involvement in several types of activities taking place throughout the semester:
* Engagement in In-Class Discussions & Activities - Each student is expected to engage him- or herself regularly and actively in class activities and discussions. This is not simply in reference to being present for and attentive in class meetings but also for offering insight into class conversations, interacting with fellow students, and so on.
* Leading Forum Discussions (2) - Each student is responsible for providing two forum discussion questions over the course of the semester (these will be scheduled by the instructor) to help facilitate both in- and out-of-class discussion.
* Responding to Forum Questions - Each student is expected to respond to at least one question a week (before the class meeting that the question is connected to) with a substantive idea that engages the point of the question. Responses may be used to help initiate in-class discussion.

## Late Work
All assignment due dates are listed in the schedule. Unless otherwise arranged, I only accept papers in electronic form (in .doc, .pdf, or in .pde for Processing sketch files).
For late papers: 1 calendar day late = -1 letter grade; 2-3 calendar days late = -2 letter grades; more than 3 days late = credit only (50% of points). You must turn in all major assignments to pass this class. 
Occasionally, I will grant extensions on papers for legitimate reasons. Please email a request for an extension at least 24 hours prior to the assignment due date. You must propose an alternate due date.

## Academic Integrity
The NCSU policy on the [Student Code of Conduct (11.35.1)](http://policies.ncsu.edu/policy/pol-11-35-1) provides an explanation of academic integrity and dishonesty. Student-teacher relationships are built on trust. You must trust that I have made appropriate decisions about the structure and content of the course, and I must trust that you have turned in assignments that are your own. Acts that violate this trust undermine the educational goals of this university.
All work in this course should be original (or remade according to rules set forth in class). Any material that you paraphrase or quote must be cited [according to APA style](http://www.docstyles.com/apacrib.htm). If you would like an explanation of the actions that constitute plagiarism, please review the [student code of conduct](http://www.ncsu.edu/student_affairs/osc/code_conduct/).

## Disability
Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students must register with [Disablity Services for Students](http://www.ncsu.edu/dso/) at 1900 Student Health Center, Campus box 7509, 515-7653. For more information on NC State's policy on working with students with disabilities, please see the [Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Regulation (REG02.20.1)](http://policies.ncsu.edu/regulation/reg-02-20-1).

## Course Evaluations
Online class evaluations will be available to complete during the last two weeks of class. You will receive an email message directing you to a website where you can login using your Unity ID. All evaluations are confidential; I will never know how you responded to any question, and you will never know the ratings for any particular instructors.
