# Course Assignments

## Discussion Forum Posts (10%)

Students will maintain regular out-of-class interaction and discussion through the course's Moodle website based on course readings and in-class discussion topics. Over the course of the semester, students will be required to provide at least twelve substantive discussion posts (of a total of seventeen potential class discussions).

## Critical Assessment Essay (10%)

This assignment serves as an initial demonstration of students' understanding (after the first several weeks of class) of the connections and relationships between rhetoric and digital technologies. The essay has a 4-6 page length requirement and the use of sources – from class readings or from outside research – is highly encouraged, especially in relation to rhetorical concepts that the students may not have been familiar with. Topics could be built upon discussions we had either in class or on our Moodle forum. Students are also encouraged to consider (whether addressed explicitly in this text or not) how they might work off of this topic into the creative projects that would follow this critically-oriented project.

Some central questions to be addressed specifically:

1. What is the issue to be discussed? (How would it be introduced and concisely described?)
2. Can we trace its background at all? 
3. Are there certain rhetorical principles or situations that we can identify as relating to this issue? (If the topic focuses on cultural implications of one or more technologies, how can we address rhetoric more explicitly within that topic?)
4. What opportunities do we have to move forward with the use of these concerns when considering digital technologies? 

Evaluation of each student text focuses on how clearly and fully students attempted to address these questions and build a discussion upon the foundation provided by these questions. 

## Creative Project 1 (20%)

Students (either individually or in small groups of 2-4 students) will create a code-related experiment undertaken in some artistic fashion (meaning that it can incorporate sound, graphical art, literature, performance, etc.). The project does not have to be digital in form, although it may be meant for a digital “end” if the project were to be developed further. The goal of this project is for students to learn about basic principles related to code and its nature in a manner distinct from the traditional academic essay.

Some questions to consider for Creative Projects 1 _and_ (to an extent) 2:

1. Description of the project: in a nutshell, what are you making? Do you have specific audiences in mind? What do you want your audience(s) - whether specified or not - to 'get' out of your project? __How do you imagine it "works," rhetorically speaking, to entice your audience to action (whatever that action may be)?__ How do you plan to get to the point where you can emphasize that rhetorical _working_?
2. Visualization of the project: whether visual or textual (or, if it's a sound-based project, auditory), how can you give us (the class and me) as full a vision of the eventual project outcome as you can, given the current plan for its development? (__Note:__ This is a concern more for Creative Project 1 than 2.) This does not have to be digital in nature: for example, if my project were to make a digital version of the Queneau sonnets demonstrated in class, I could show off a physical, cut-paper version as a prototype for the mechanisms of the code (which in this case would be a giant, stapled collection of Arrays!). 
3. Plans for code: whether you feel like you have any clue about how you'll successfully put the project together through code, how do you imagine data might get manipulated to achieve certain activities? Have you tried coding anything up yet (whether or not it works is incidental), and if so, what is it? 
4. For group projects, each member's role: what is each person contributing and planning to contribute? How are you all coming together so far to make this happen? Are there divergent directions for the project you're contemplating but haven't come to a consensus on yet?

## Midterm Presentation (5%)

Students will provide a six-to-eight-minute presentation of their creative project and explain to the class what principles guided the creation and composition of the experiment. The goal is for each student to have the opportunity to engage in the development of computational methods to produce an artifact that may prove helpful for understanding concepts discussed in the second half of the semester (when similar methods are applied, albeit in often very different manners, to digital media).

## Creative Project 2 (20%)

Students (either individually or in small groups of 2-4 students) will explore a digital medium (the Processing IDE) and its capabilities of serving humanist interests. This is not merely a 'digital art' project, but an effort to understand some of the ways that information or human sensation can be affected by this medium and its interfaces in ways that begin to transcend the possibilities of traditional, conventional media. Further, the project should seek to perform some rhetorical purpose for particular (or general) audiences, building off of class readings and discussions.

Preceding the final version of the project is a rough draft or prototype sketched out by the group (or individual student) to explain what the initial goals for the project are, the intended audience(s) for the artifact, and what potential form(s) the project may exist in upon its completion.

## Artist's Statement (10%)

Students will compose (individually) 5-7 page documents that incorporate the critical texts and issues discussed in class in order to explore the potential significance(s) of the works created for Creative Project 2 (and, if relevant, Creative Project 1). How do the project fit into the broader scope of artistic and scholarly work being undertaken currently and/or historically? What sorts of rhetorical action does the project hope to engage audiences in undertaking or considering? How might the project be expanded on and developed further, were the artist(s) to have more time and resources available to do so?

## Final Presentation (10%)

Similar to the midterm presentation, students will provide a ten minute presentation of their second creative project and explain to the class what principles guided the creation and composition of the experiment, what the revision process entailed, what problems were faced (successfully or unsuccessfully), and how the project connects to a broader community of artists, coders, and scholars interested in and working with similar technologies and concerns.

## In-Class Participation (15%)

Students are expected to contribute substantively to discussions and activities taking place within the classroom. This includes comprehension of and engagement with readings, code languages, and concerns informing the use of code for humanities-related ends.

## General Evaluative Criteria

### Creative Projects:

* Engagement with code concepts addressed in readings, discussions, and activities. This is not an expectation that a student will be a proficient or "elegant" coder but instead it is an expectation that each student will demonstrate a solid effort to understand and apply the material covered in the course towards rhetorical ends.

### Critical Assessment Essay / Artist's Statement:

* Engagement with major concepts addressed in readings, discussions, and activities.
* Articulation of applied code concepts for appropriate audience(s).

### Discussion Forum Posts:
* As with in-class participation, each student is expected to engage regularly in critically-informed and substantive discourse with his or her classmates and the instructor.
