# The Basics of New Media (per Manovich)

## What is "new media"?

### Numerical representation
1. Digital code (encoded binary numbers) make up a new media "object", and code is subject to algorithmic manipulation

* A non-digital example of new media: a film is made up of discrete photographs that are combined into frames of a continuous, timeline-based "shot"

2. "Media becomes programmable"

### Modularity

1. "The fractal structure of new media" - new media objects have the same structure & independence of components throughout multiple levels of their existence

* Example: a website is comprised of textual characters, links to other sites, images, sound, etc. - each of these components can be modified without necessitating modifications to any other component

### Automation

1. Algorithms can be created to produce, automatically, new media objects and experiences (from computer-generated art to video game AI to Amazon suggested purchases)

### Variability

1. New media can exist in "different, potentially infinite, versions" thanks to their numerical and modular makeup

* Example: a single database may have a number of different interfaces created for people to engage with that data (e.g. the world wide web)

### Transcoding

1.  Meaning created in cultural and computer layers (and the relationship of each with the other)

* Computer layer: file size, file type, variables used to manipulate the file, its organization in a system/network
* Cultural layer: meaning for humans (is it a funny image? Is it a tragic short story? Is it important to a particular person?)

2. For Manovich, the computer layer has an increasingly significant influence over the cultural layer – that is, we begin to ascribe meaning culturally to new media objects based on how we understand them through their 'computer layer'


## Propositions for/of new media

### New media vs. cyberculture

1. New media is not inherently social (and yet, it is social interaction that influences much of cultural construction/development)
2. Computers as models for/of "reality"

### As computer technology used as distribution platform

1. Distinction between computer-based production and distribution – for Manovich, experiencing media through a computer is significant, as it defines one's exposure to or interaction with that media

### As digital data controlled by software

1. Perhaps the most significant point of the article: digital media does not simply spring out of nothing, and our ability to interact with particular media in particular ways is constrained greatly by the software used to create, distribute, and interact with it

* What Manovich leaves off: who makes this software?

### As mix between cultural conventions and conventions of software
1. Continued efforts to merge cultural & computer layers of new media together to make effective use of numerical data and meaning ascribed to that data (see "Transcoding" above)

* Example: "cut", "copy", and "paste" in word processing programs

### As aesthetics accompanying the early stage of every new modern media & communication technology

1. Often referred to as "hypermediacy" vs. "immediacy" in media studies (for more, check out Bolter & Grusin, _Remediation_)

2. We want to understand each new media technology as a paradigm-shifting event that will radically redefine life as we know it ? Manovich suggests that instead we may want to focus on what new technologies offer us in regards to creative & distributive practices and capabilities

### As faster execution of algorithms previously executed manually or through other technologies

1. Computers allow us to perform numerous different tasks, and we have the capacity to create algorithms so that our computers facilitate these tasks

### As the encoding of modern avant-garde; as metamedia

1. Rather than trying to create new forms through which to understand/see the world, we are at a point where we can come up with new ways to use existing information to understand the world

### As parallel articulation of similar ideas in post-WWII art and modern computing

1. Combinatorics as literary & artistic approaches to computational algorithms (we'll talk more about this a few classes from now)
