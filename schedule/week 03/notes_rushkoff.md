# Notes on Digital Rhetoric via Rushkoff's _Program or Be Programmed_ (Intro, Ch.1, Ch. 3)

## Introduction

1. Compare Rushkoff's initial statements about the capabilities of digital technologies to Manovich's ? who seems to be (more) accurate? (pp. 14-15)
2. What is the "cybernetic organism" and how does it enter into our considerations of digital technologies/media and rhetoric? (p. 17)

    * “Where does my body end and the tool begin?” (p. 22) ? how does this affect the way we allow ourselves to be programmed, assuming we agree with Rushkoff's point?
        * Computers, or cyborgs, as models of/for reality?
        * What might this tell us about digital rhetors, audiences, and/or situations?

3. "[Kids] have the access to the capabilities given to them by others, but not the power to determine the value-creating capabilities of these technologies for themselves" (p. 19)

## Time – Do Not Always Be On

1. "Because computer code is biased away from continuous time, so too are the programs built on it, and the human behaviors those programs encourage" (p. 31)

    * How do email, text messaging, DVR, and other types of "suspended-time" technologies influence our actions and ways of understanding/interacting with the world?
    * Do these technologies & processes truly degrade our memory, as Rushkoff suggests? (p. 39) ? see phone numbers, driving directions, recipes, etc.
    * Is “opting out” the only alternative we have to this model of thought & behavior?

## Choice – You May Always Choose None of the Above

1. Analog vs. digital representations/calculations of data

    * Need to explain flow of water for analog values?

2. "The digital realm is biased towards choice, because everything must be expressed in the terms of a discrete, yes-or-no, symbolic language. This, in turn, often forces choices on humans operating within the digital sphere" (p. 55)
3. Tagging as one alternative to restricted/forced choice?

    * Compare Yahoo's directory to Google's, a la [Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html)

## The Logic of Code

1. Conditional Statements ([If this, Then that](http://ifttt.com/))

    * Boolean true/false
    * __Class activity__: establish conditional statements / flowcharts describing how to make a peanut butter & jelly sandwich
