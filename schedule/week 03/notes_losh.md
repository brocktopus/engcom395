# Notes on Digital Rhetoric (via [Losh](http://digitalrhetoric.org/))

## What is ["digital rhetoric"](http://digitalrhetoric.org/what1.html)?

1. Rhetorical study has primarily focused on public speaking (oratory) and writing

    * What qualities from these subjects might we extend to digital environments/media?
    * Literacy as a skillset
        * Do digital media work off of the combined literacies of print and screen?
            * The rhetorical conventions of new digital genres in everyday discourse

## What is a "genre"? What does a genre _do_ rhetorically?

1. C.R. Miller: a genre is a key "to understanding how to participate in the actions of a community"

    * Is email a genre? Or a website?
        * __Class activity__: locate an artifact/document that you believe represents a particular genre, and we'll discuss a few examples together
    * What sorts of communities are we thinking about or trying to engage with?

2. Public rhetoric via electronic distributed networks or hypertext

## Hypertext arguably eliminates the traditional model of rhetoric

1. It bypasses arrangement & memory
2. It eliminates ethos and the 'authentic' voice of public authority

    * __Class activity__: visit the following sites
        * [whitehouse.gov](whitehouse.gov) & [whitehouse.gov1.info](whitehouse.gov1.info)
        * [janecorwin.com](janecorwin.com) & [janecorwin.org](janecorwin.org)

3. Scholarly methods of interpretation for the critical analysis of new media

## Consequences of incomplete/partial digital literacy

1. Economic and professional disadvantages
2. Loss of social capital
3. Incomplete cultural citizenship
4. Problem-solving capacities limited by never getting beyond tool literacy

## Types of literacy

1. Functional/technical literacy
2. Rhetorical literacy
3. Critical literacy

    * How are any of these learned? 
    * How does "crowdsourcing" and similar types of collaboration affect digitally-based rhetorical invention & appeal? (Losh mentions blogs & wikis, for example)
    * What about learning how the technologies work – is this necessary?
    * How does the oft-heard argument for/against the "digital native" enter into this argument?

## What is the distinction between information and knowledge?

1. Does digital rhetoric focus on these principles?
    * engineer redundancy
    * overcome noise
    * anticipate feedback in the system

1. Discuss the _enthymeme_ – the incomplete syllogism
