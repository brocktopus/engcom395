# An Introduction to Rhetoric

## Basic Definition(s)

1. Aristotle: Rhetoric is the knowledge/recognition and use of "all available forms of persuasion"
2. The "art of language" that, for a long time, was part of the central "trivium" of education along with logic and grammar

## Canons

1. Invention – creation ("discovery") and display/use of the most effective means of presenting an argument
2. Arrangement – construction ("assembly") of the argument in a particular order
3. Memory – for public speaking, to recall easily and effectively the argument
4. Delivery – presentation of the argument for a particular audience in a mediated setting (public speech, email, courtroom closing argument, instant message, etc.)
5. Style – ornamentation, language, constraint that defines how we approach the use of these canons

## Rhetorical Situation

1. Rhetor – speaker/author/etc.
2. Audience – recipient of communication
3. Constraints – those qualities that will influence how the audience receives and responds to the rhetor's argument
4. Exigence - "imperfection marked by urgency" - the need to act (in _this way_)

* Kairos – knowing what to say/do at the right time in the right situation
