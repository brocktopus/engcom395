# Course Schedule - Week 11

## Tuesday - Code(d) language & arrays

__Reading__: 
* Berge, Claude. "For a Potential Analysis of Combinatory Literature." _Oulipo_. pp. 115-125.
* Reas, Casey and Ben Fry. _Getting Started with Processing_. Chapter 10.

__In Class__: Causing data to transform into "other" data and exploring sets of information.

## Thursday - Code updates & discussion

__NO CLASS__: In lieu of a class meeting, you are expected to post, as a discussion forum post, your Processing code for a sketch you've been working on along with an explanation of what you want it to do, what it does, and what you plan to do to continue building upon that idea & code.
* Your code will not be graded, and I expect everyone to have 'rough draft' code, so to speak. This is a chance for you to talk through what you've been working on and to see (and ask about) what your classmates are working on.
