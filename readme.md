# ENG/COM 395: Code, Computation, & Rhetoric

## An upper-level undergraduate humanities course on digital media and rhetoric

This project serves as an archival repository of the materials used in an upper-level humanities course (a 'special topics' course on digital media & rhetoric), geared primarily towards students of English and Communication, at North Carolina State University (Spring 2012). 

The focus of the course was on "code, computation, & rhetoric" - an exploration of both the rhetorical capabilities and implications of software code and the computational qualities of rhetoric. This was accomplished by working critically and creatively to understand the fundamental principles of rhetoric and computation that underlie persuasion and software use, respectively.

None of the students enrolled in the course was expected to have any experience with any kind of programming or coding language (including HTML).

This class was taught by Kevin Brock (kevin_brock@ncsu.edu).

The directory structure is as follows (not including the 'data' subdirectories for some of the code examples):
